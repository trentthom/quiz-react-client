we need to look at the react router docs to find a way to use params from the url

topicId is the name of our params as we declared that in the app BrowserRouter

using that id make a req to the back end for q's related to that topic


*we don't have functionality on the backend to make a req to  GET  questions/:topicId/

** and as the q's and a's are at different entities we need a way to do the above for answers also

** make the back end fetch both q's and a's from one request -- we don't have to strictly do this


------Will would recommend the back end to the aggregation ie find the right q's and a's


make the back end loop through the questions and fetch the relevant answers!!!

//////////////////////after we get the above sorted

/questions will be loaded ALL of them (for the topic) and also the answers....then have to find a way to increment by one to dispplay the next q's and a's into state.....


.......Will's example of state on Game

questions: [{
  ... fields like id
  text: 'what color is the sky?'
  answers: [{
     text: 'gray',
     correct: true/false
   }]
}]









b4 nat wakes up

make the functionality for the front end
